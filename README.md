# Heart Attack Analyzer

### Overview
The **Heart Attack Analyzer** is a machine learning-based project designed to predict the likelihood of a heart attack based on key health indicators. By analyzing factors such as cholesterol levels, blood pressure, age, and other medical data, this tool provides early insights into heart attack risks. The aim is to help healthcare professionals and individuals identify high-risk cases, contributing to preventive care.

### Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Efficient handling of missing values, data normalization, and feature selection using Pandas and NumPy.
- **Visualization:** Visual representation of health data using Matplotlib and Seaborn for better understanding of risk factors.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Includes Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models built with Scikit-learn.
- **Model Evaluation:** Performance evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
- **Interactive Prediction:** Simple user interface that allows input of health metrics to predict heart attack risk.

### Technologies Used
- **Python** for core programming
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for building and evaluating machine learning models
